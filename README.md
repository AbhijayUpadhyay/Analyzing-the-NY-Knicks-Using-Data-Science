# Analyzing-the-NY-Knicks-Using-Data-Science

(This project was completed around May 10th, 2025. This means it has data from the 2024-2025 regular season and round 1 of the playoofs against the Detroit Pistons.
It does not contain the data from the Knicks' series against the Celtics or Pacers.)

Analyzing the New York Knicks Using Data Science (2024–2025 Season)
I analyzed the Knicks’ performance throughout the 2024–2025 NBA season and playoffs using data science techniques. After cleaning and preprocessing game data, I applied:

Clustering (K-Means, PCA) to group NBA teams and Knicks games by offensive and defensive efficiency.

Decision Trees & KNN to predict game outcomes (win/loss) based on opponent and performance stats.

Visualizations including histograms, radar plots, and cluster charts to communicate trends clearly.

Key Insight: The Knicks rely on defensive tenacity in order to win games. Additionally, the Knicks consistently beat weaker teams and struggled against stronger opponents, with shifts in offensive and defensive balance during the playoffs. 

This project highlights my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning, applied to real-world sports analytics.
